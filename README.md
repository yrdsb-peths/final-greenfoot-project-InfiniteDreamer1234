# Rush hour! 
Welcome to rush hour! You are currently an employee that works for a very strcit boss. Despite setting mutiple of alarms this morning, you still slept thorugh them! With your job on the line, you hop into your car and rush towards work without being late! Good luck trying to dodge all the cars!
